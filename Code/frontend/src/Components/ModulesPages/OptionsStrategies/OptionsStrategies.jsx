                Options strategies are different approaches to using options
                contracts to achieve various financial goals, like hedging
                risks, generating income, or speculating on stock price
                movements. Common strategies involve combining call and put
                options in ways that align with your market expectations. These
                strategies can be designed to profit from a stock's upward or
                downward movement, or even from it staying within a certain
                range. A solid understanding of the basics of options, along
                with practice and careful planning, is key to successfully
                implementing these strategies.

            There are several popular options strategies:
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Covered Call: </strong>
            This strategy involves selling call options on stocks you already
            own, providing a way to earn extra income. If the stock's price
            rises above the call's strike price, you might need to sell the
            stock, but you keep the premium you earned from selling the option.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Protective Put: </strong> This strategy helps you hedge
            against a potential drop in a stock's price. By buying a put option,
            you get the right to sell the stock at a set price, providing
            protection if the stock market declines.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Straddle: </strong> A straddle involves buying both a call
            and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date.
            It's useful when you expect significant price movement but aren't
            sure which way it'll go. It allows you to profit from volatility.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Iron Condor: </strong>This more complex strategy combines
            two calls and two puts with different strike prices. It aims to
            profit from a stock staying within a specific price range. If the
            stock stays within this range, you keep the premiums from the sold
            options, creating a balanced risk approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of these strategies has a different risk profile, and it's
            important to understand the potential outcomes before implementing
            them. Practice with a simulator, read up on the strategies, and
            consider advice from experienced traders to ensure you're using the
            right strategy for your goals and risk tolerance.
