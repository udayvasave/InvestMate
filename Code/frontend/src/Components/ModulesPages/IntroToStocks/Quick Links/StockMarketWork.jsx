                    The stock market is where companies raise money by selling
                    shares of stock to investors. When you buy a share, you own
                    a small part of the company. This gives you certain rights,
                    like voting on company matters and receiving dividends.

                    Investors, including individuals and institutions, buy and
                    sell stocks on stock exchanges. When you buy a share, you're
                    purchasing it from another investorâ€”not directly from the
                    company. The same happens when you sell; you're selling to
                    another investor.

                    A stock exchange is a place where stocks are bought and
                    sold. It's like a marketplace for shares. The first stock
                    exchanges appeared in Europe in the 16th century. The New
                    York Stock Exchange (NYSE), founded in 1792, is one of the
                    most well-known exchanges today. Another major exchange is
                    the Nasdaq.

                    A stock market index is a measure of the performance of a

                    specific sector is doing. Major indexes include:

                    Companies sell shares to raise capital for expansion,
                    hiring, equipment, and more. Startups might initially get
                    money from personal savings or angel investors. When they
                    need more funds, they might go public by listing shares on a
                    stock exchange through an initial public offering (IPO).

                    Share prices are set by supply and demand. If more people
                    want to buy a stock (demand), the price goes up. If more
                    people want to sell (supply), the price goes down. The

                    People can lose money by investing in high-risk securities,
                    selling during a crash, or using margin trading, which
                    magnifies gains and losses. It's often best to hold onto
                    stocks during downturns, as they may recover over time.
