                    Investors buy stocks for income, to sell later at a profit,

                    While "stock market" and "stock exchange" are often used
                    interchangeably, they have different meanings. The stock

                    while stock exchanges are specific places (often virtual)
                    where stocks are bought and sold. The major U.S. stock

                    When you buy a stock, you're purchasing a piece of a
                    company. The size of your ownership depends on the total
                    number of shares issued by the company and how many shares
                    you own. Owning shares grants you the right to a portion of
                    the company's profits, often paid as dividends, and
                    sometimes the right to vote on company matters.

                    Stock exchanges are organized platforms where stocks and
                    other securities are bought and sold. These exchanges are
                    central to the financial system, providing a venue for
                    companies to raise capital and for investors to trade
                    securities. The NYSE and Nasdaq are major U.S. exchanges,
                    and there are others worldwide, each with its own set of
                    rules and regulations. Stock exchanges offer liquidity,

                    Institutional investors, such as pension funds, mutual

                    individuals trading for personal accounts, ranging from
                    beginners to experienced traders, typically using online
                    platforms. Accredited investors are high-net-worth

                    access more complex investments like venture capital and

                    over time through stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and other

                    Brokers are intermediaries between investors and the

                    execute trades on behalf of clients and can range from
                    full-service firms to discount brokers. Full-service brokers

                    catering to clients who prefer a more personalized approach.
                    Discount brokers offer a more hands-off experience, favored

                    The bond market and stock market serve different purposes.
                    The bond market involves buying and selling debt securities,
                    offering regular interest payments and lower risk, while the
                    stock market involves buying shares and derivatives with

                People buy stocks for various reasons. Some seek income from
                dividends, while others hope to profit by buying low and selling
                high. Stocks also offer voting rights at shareholder meetings
                based on the number of shares owned.
              </p>
              <h2>{heading.title}</h2>
             
              <p>
                While "stock market" and "stock exchange" are often used
                interchangeably, they have different meanings. The stock market
                encompasses all trading activities involving stocks, while stock
                exchanges are specific places (often virtual) where stocks are
                bought and sold. The major U.S. stock exchanges are the New York
                Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq.
              </p>
            
            <h2>{heading.title}</h2>
            
            <p>The stock market functions as a complex network where companies raise funds by issuing stocks to investors. It allows investors to buy and sell shares, usually through stock exchanges, with regulations in place to ensure fair practices. This market plays a crucial role in facilitating the flow of money between companies and investors.</p>
            
            <h2>Public Companies and IPOs</h2>
            
            <p>Not every company can offer stock to the public. Only public companies that have gone through an initial public offering (IPO) can list their shares on stock exchanges like the NYSE or Nasdaq. Public companies must follow strict financial disclosure rules to maintain transparency.</p>
            <h2>What Are Stocks?</h2>
            
            <p>When you buy a stock, you're purchasing a piece of a company. The size of your ownership depends on the total number of shares issued by the company and how many shares you own. Owning shares grants you the right to a portion of the company's profits, often paid as dividends, and sometimes the right to vote on company matters.</p>
            
            <h2>Stock Exchanges</h2>
            
            <p>Stock exchanges are organized platforms where stocks and other securities are bought and sold. These exchanges are central to the financial system, providing a venue for companies to raise capital and for investors to trade securities. The NYSE and Nasdaq are major U.S. exchanges, and there are others worldwide, each with its own set of rules and regulations. Stock exchanges offer liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell stocks relatively easily during trading hours.</p>
            
            <h2>Other Assets in the Stock Market</h2>
            
            <p>The stock market includes more than just common stocks. It also encompasses other assets such as:</p>
            <p><strong>American depositary receipts (ADRs): </strong>Represent shares in foreign companies but are traded on U.S. stock exchanges.</p>
            <p><strong>Derivatives: </strong>These include options and futures, which derive their value from other assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities.</p>
            <p><strong>Funds:</strong>These are mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that pool money to invest in various securities.</p>
            <p><strong>Preferred stocks: </strong>These generally offer set dividends and have priority over common stock in getting a share of the profits.</p>
            <p><strong>Real estate investment trusts (REITs): </strong>These companies own or finance real estate, providing dividends to shareholders.</p> */
